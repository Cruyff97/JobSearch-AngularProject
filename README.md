# FindJob

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.1.

## Description 
This is a small project using Angular for a jobsearch site. The site uses API from themuse.com for showing engineering avaibles jobs. It is possible to choose beetween Enter Level Jobs, Middle Level Jobs, Senior Level Jobs, internship and manager positions. In addition it is possible to insert a company name to show their avaible positions.
So i made different API calls for this project and utilize angular features such as directives, services and others. 
# What i learned
I learned how Angular works and how it helps application developing. I think angular has a very high learning curve, but when you're comfortable with it, really helps and simplify development. 
In addition I learned Typescript which is also usefull to fill some gaps that Javascript has.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
